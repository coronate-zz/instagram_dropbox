# Instagram-Dropbox filesystem

This project allows you to sync the dropbox api with the instagram api. Giving you acces to one picture at a time (not comsuming memory resources) and uploading the picures inside your folder acording to an preconfigured schedule (see chrontab.txt). This project is really useful for photographers that don't whant to spend much time uploading photos and changing details through the instagram app. It also use a conventinal naming that gives some credibility to the pictures and provide information to the followers (explain in more detail).
